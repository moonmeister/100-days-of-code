# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started working through freecodcamp.org challenges and completed the first 80.

**Thoughts**: I've tinkered a lot as a Systems administrator but these challenges help put stuff together and reveal some of the finer nuances of html and especially CSS that i've missed. I'll be using this all at work soon.

### Day 2: January 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Made it through the jQuery section of freeCodeCamp to the first project. Got a codepen.io account setup and ready to get started on the project.

**Thoughts**: all seemed pretty straight forward. I got to the project and had no idea where to start. I guess copying/extrapolating code is a lot easier then remembering on these things and creating your own. I look forward to moving forward and getting these skills down.

**Time Spent**: 1.5 hrs

### Day 3: January 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Made it through most of the first challenge on freeCodeCamp. Have some content to fill out and realized they're using Bootstrap 3 in their example so all the custom CSS I was struggling with wasn't need, I just had to go from ?BS4?-->?BS3? (Is that how you abbreviate bootstrap?).

**Thoughts**: Did a lot of looking at the example code which kinda seemed like cheating. But, I did some reading of the bootstrap documentation to understand who/how everything worked and made sure to type everything out my self, no copy->paste.

### Day 4: January 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Made it through the Tribute page project. On to the Portfolio page.

**Thoughts**: So...evidently I wasn't suppose to look at the example code. It was like the first line in the video for the portfolio page. I guess I should have watched the video for the last one. In my defense, it wasn't in the "rules". Oh well! Got started on the portfolio, got most of a nav bar roughed out.

### Day 5: January 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: got the about section close enough. Moving on to the portfolio section. I'm trying to rough stuff in then I'll come back and dial it in. ~break~ Another 3.5 hrs in the rearview mirror. Got some portfolio cards done up and added some cool Icons for the languages/libraries used in the making of said projects. Made an arrow do some cool rotations when you click it.

**Thoughts**: getting easier! and making more sense. Today had more problem solving...how I do love it though!

**Time Spent**: 3.75 hrs

### Day 6: January 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today got a bit tedious. Got the portfolio cards better formatted and so the flex better on resize. Started on the footer and all the flow and stuff was just off and I wasn't feeling it.

**Thoughts**: Need a break...too many hours. Maybe I need not to do 3 hrs a day.

### Day 7: January 8, 2018

I'm confused. Somewhere I lost a day...but I didn't skip a day of coding. I've also done a good job of always logging stuff...who knows.

### Day 8: January 9, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished out the portfolio project and bought a domain to host it on.

**Thoughts**: I have my own website...how weird.

### Day 9: January 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: More freeCodeCamp, lots of Javascript basics. go some ~50 lessons done.

**Thoughts**: Nothing terribly mind blowing. I know most of this from every other language I know. Some good little bits and refreshers on the specifics of JS.
