# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started working through freecodcamp.org challenges and completed the first 80.

**Thoughts**: I've tinkered a lot as a Systems administrator but these challenges help put stuff together and reveal some of the finer nuances of html and especially CSS that i've missed. I'll be using this all at work soon.

### Day 2: January 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Made it through the jQuery section of freeCodeCamp to the first project. Got a codepen.io account setup and ready to get started on the project.

**Thoughts**: all seemed pretty straight forward. I got to the project and had no idea where to start. I guess copying/extrapolating code is a lot easier then remembering on these things and creating your own. I look forward to moving forward and getting these skills down.
