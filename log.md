# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started working through freecodcamp.org challenges and completed the first 80.

**Thoughts**: I've tinkered a lot as a Systems administrator but these challenges help put stuff together and reveal some of the finer nuances of html and especially CSS that i've missed. I'll be using this all at work soon.

### Day 2: January 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Made it through the jQuery section of freeCodeCamp to the first project. Got a codepen.io account setup and ready to get started on the project.

**Thoughts**: all seemed pretty straight forward. I got to the project and had no idea where to start. I guess copying/extrapolating code is a lot easier then remembering on these things and creating your own. I look forward to moving forward and getting these skills down.

### Day 3: January 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Made it through most of the first challenge on freeCodeCamp. Have some content to fill out and realized they're using Bootstrap 3 in their example so all the custom CSS I was struggling with wasn't need, I just had to go from ?BS4?-->?BS3? (Is that how you abbreviate bootstrap?).

**Thoughts**: Did a lot of looking at the example code which kinda seemed like cheating. But, I did some reading of the bootstrap documentation to understand who/how everything worked and made sure to type everything out my self, no copy->paste.

### Day 4: January 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Made it through the Tribute page project. On to the Portfolio page.

**Thoughts**: So...evidently I wasn't suppose to look at the example code. It was like the first line in the video for the portfolio page. I guess I should have watched the video for the last one. In my defense, it wasn't in the "rules". Oh well! Got started on the portfolio, got most of a nav bar roughed out.

**Today's Progress**: Checked out some good real examples of portfolio pages. This inspired me to try moving the nave to the bottom. I'll also include a pretty detail footer but I'm going to try and nest it with the nave then have a link to expand. We'll see how it turns out. I got the expansion working though!

**Thoughts**: Coming along well, definitely not as hard as I've imagined.
