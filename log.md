# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started working through freecodcamp.org challenges and completed the first 80.

**Thoughts**: I've tinkered a lot as a Systems administrator but these challenges help put stuff together and reveal some of the finer nuances of html and especially CSS that i've missed. I'll be using this all at work soon.
